### Deployment: https://fem-bitcoin-clock.vercel.app/ ###

----

This project is a responsive Clock app built with React. The Clock relies on a combination of external APIs to set time and theme based on location data. An easter egg is hidden in the app, converting it into a Bitcoin price dashboard.

This project started as front-end challenge from Frontend Mentor. The aim was to create a responsive mobile-first clock dashboard working with external APIs to set time data based on a visitor's location and generate random programming quotes. Inspired by the Moscow Time meme spawned from Jack Dorsey's House Committee hearing, I added a Bitcoin 'Blockclock' to display relevant bitcoin price and blockchain data. The quotes are linked to a firebase database containing some Satoshi Nakamoto's important quotes from the BitcoinTalk forum before leaving the project in late 2010.
